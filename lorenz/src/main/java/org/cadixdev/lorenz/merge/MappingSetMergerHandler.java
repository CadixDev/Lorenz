/**
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for handling the individual merge conditions found in the default {@link MappingSetMerger}.
 * It may be simpler to override the default implementation of this class to handle any particular cases you wish to
 * modify rather than overriding {@link MappingSetMerger}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All methods in this class are intended to create the <i>base-mapping only</i>. That is to say, for a merge of 2 class
 * mappings, the method should merge only the name of said class and return it, not process the rest of the class's
 * members. The {@link MappingSetMerger} will handle recursively calling individual mapping methods for the members.
 * </p>
 * <hr>
 * <p>
 * <b>Continuations and Duplicates:</b>
 * <br>
 * This class distinguishes between the normal merge case and a duplicate merge case. A normal merge case is when the
 * {@code left} mapping maps {@code A -> B} and the {@code right} mapping maps {@code B -> C}. This can be thought of
 * as a mapping chain, where the deobfuscated side of the {@code left} mapping lines up with the obfuscated side of the
 * {@code right} mapping. This is what is referred to as a <i>continuation</i>, since in this case the {@code right}
 * mapping "continues" the chain. All of the {@code right} mappings in the normal merge methods are continuations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There also exists the possibility that the {@code right} mapping set will duplicate the {@code left}. That means that
 * the {@code left} mapping maps {@code A -> B}, and the {@code right} mapping maps {@code A -> C} (or {@code A -> B}
 * too, what matters is the obfuscated sides match). In this case the obfuscated side of the {@code left} mapping
 * matches the obfuscated side of the right mapping. This is what this class refers to as a <i>duplicate</i> mapping.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code mergeDuplicate*} methods in this class have 2 {@code right} mapping parameters, one called {@code right}
 * and the other called {@code rightContinuation}. If the duplicate method is called that means a duplicate has already
 * been detected, which is why the {@code right} mapping is never {@code null}. In this situation there is still a
 * possibility of a continuation mapping existing in the {@code right} mapping set, however. Put another way, the
 * {@code left} mapping set may map {@code A -> B}, and the {@code right} mapping set may map <i>both</i> {@code A -> C}
 * <i>and</i> {@code B -> D} (or {@code B -> C}, the left side is what matters here). If this situation occurs, then the
 * {@code rightContinuation} parameter will not be {@code null} and the handler implementation will need to handle this
 * case. The default implementation just assumes the duplicated {@code right} mapping is the correct mapping and throws
 * away the {@code rightContinuation} mapping. Note that attempting to keep both will always fail (in the default case)
 * because both would eventually resolve to the same obfuscated names.
 * </p>
 *
 * @implSpec In order to properly implement this interface extra care must be taken for the
 *           {@link #addRightMethodMapping(MethodMapping, ClassMapping, MergeContext) addRightMethod()} method. This
 *           method has a special case that no other method has in the standard merge case, which is that the obfuscated
 *           types of the method descriptor may be mapped to the deobfuscated types of the left side (which has no
 *           matching mapping in this case). In order to properly map this case you must also make a best-effort to map
 *           the obfuscated types of the descriptor to the obfuscated mappings of the left side. All handler methods
 *           have a {@link MergeContext context} parameter to help with these kinds of situations.
