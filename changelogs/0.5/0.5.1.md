Lorenz 0.5.1
============

Lorenz 0.5.1 brings some minor additions, that were missed during previous dev cycles,
identified during the development of Lorenz 0.6.

## ProGuard Reader

Lorenz 0.5.1 includes a `lorenz-io-proguard` module, that allows you to read
ProGuard output files (for example, Mojang's mapping files for Minecraft). You can
obtain the ProGuard `MappingFormat` with `MappingFormats.byId("proguard")`.

Importantly, the ProGuard module **does not** support writing mapping files.
