## Writer configurations

Writer configurations are a powerful new feature that allows the output of
mappings writers to be fine-tuned as consumers would like. Currently, this
is limited to:

- The sorting functions used to write mappings for classes, fields, and
  methods.
- The API is open-ended, so there is potential for further additions to be
  made.

Writer configurations can be created fluently through use the provided
builder, which includes our default implementations.

```java
protected MappingsWriterConfig config = MappingsWriterConfig.builder()
        .classMappingComparator(Comparator.comparing(Mapping::getFullObfuscatedName))
        .fieldMappingComparator(Comparator.comparing(Mapping::getFullObfuscatedName))
        .methodMappingComparator(Comparator.comparing(Mapping::getFullObfuscatedName))
        .build();
```

They are applied to a mappings writer by use of the new `#setConfig` method,
and can be retrieved through the corresponding `#getConfig()` method.

```java
writer.setConfig(MappingsWriterConfig.builder().build());
```

## Fixes

- The Kin mapping writer now produces consistent output, sorting the
  mappings as per the provided comparators. Output is also now rid of 'junk'
  mappings (those without valid children mappings, or a de-obf mapping of
  their own).
