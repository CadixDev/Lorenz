Lorenz 0.5.3
============

Lorenz 0.5.3 includes yet-another set of bug-fixes:

- [Mercury/GH-14]: Inheritance completion now considers elevated return types
- [Bombe/GH-11]: Bump Bombe dependency to 0.3.2, including a fix for remapping
  manifests without a `Main-Class` attribute
- [Lorenz/GH-30]: Don't wrap `Writer`s in `TextMappingsWriter`, allowing files
  larger than `BufferedWriter`s buffer to be written (thanks to @phase for this
  bug-fix)
- [Lorenz/GH-32]: Support blank comments in IO readers (affects SRG formats, JAM,
  and Enigma)
  
Support for yet-another SRG variant, XSRG, has also been introduced with this
release - the format is the same as the SRG format, though has field types
([Lorenz/GH-33]).

Thanks to @phase and @DemonWav for their contributions towards this release.
  
### Registries

`Registry` has been expanded to expose more of the underlying `Map`'s data:

- `Registry#keys()`, returning a `Set` of `String`s which correspond to the
  identifier of registered values.
- `Registry#entries()`, returning a `Set` of `Map.Entry`s.

### Improved Mapping Merging

Mapping Merging, introduced with Lorenz 0.5.0, has always been a fairly
lacklustre implementation - dropping mappings present on the b mapping set, if
there wasn't a mapping in the a mapping set.

Thanks to @DemonWav, that has now been resolved (see [Lorenz/GH-36]).
