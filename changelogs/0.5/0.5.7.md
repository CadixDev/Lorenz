Lorenz 0.5.7

## Fixes

- CSRG and TSRG now ignore package mappings, rather than erroneously reading them
  as class mappings.
- `MappingSet#deobfuscate(FieldType)` will now correctly de-obfuscate object types
  of inner classes, where the parent class has a mapping - but the inner class
  does not.
- [GH-29]\: Avoid inheriting field mappings from a parent where the child class has
  a field of its own, of the same signature.
