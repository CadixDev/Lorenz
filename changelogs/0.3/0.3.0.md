Lorenz 0.3.0
============

This version of Lorenz largely builds on the efforts of the previous release, in addition
to some preparation for supporting the Enigma and JAM mapping formats.

## Changes

- In accordance with the Java specification, I have corrected the naming of MethodDescriptor
  / MethodSignature (I had them the reverse way round).
- Model construction is now handled through a `MappingSetModelFactory` - allowing models to
  be used together
- Introduced an (unused) FieldSignature and FieldTypeProvider

## Migrating from 0.2.0

Migration should be a fairly easy task, unless MethodDescriptor/MethodSignature was used.
There have been no other breaking changes.

*Lorenz is available through Maven Central*.
