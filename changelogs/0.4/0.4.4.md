Lorenz 0.4.4
============

Lorenz 0.4.4 is the combination of bugs identified in the development of Lorenz 0.5.0, specifically
with regards to the mapping format implementations, in addition to a faulty mapping model method.

## IO

- TSRG: Don't write empty class line for parents
- TSRG: Correct a length check, preventing some **valid** mappings from being read
- Enigma: Output field types properly, using the *obfuscated* type

## Mapping Model

- Fix the faulty implementation of `ClassMapping::hasMappings`, specifically it did'nt consider method
  argument mappings
