Lorenz 0.2.0
============

This version of Lorenz begins to address some of the issues that present using it within
Nocturne - which is largely driving the functionality I desire for 1.0.0.

## Changes

- The API has been split from the implementation
- The parser classes have been renamed: `*Parser -> *Processor`, `.parser. -> .reader.`
- The two variants of SRG are now supported: CSRG and TSRG

## Migrating from 0.1.0

Despite the far-reaching internal changes, migrating from 0.1.0 is a rather simple procedure.

- Model classes can no longer be constructed manually, instead the `createMapping` methods
  should be used. To create a MappingSet, `MappingSet.create()` should be used
- The reader class imports will need to be changes, to use the new package name and class
  names mentioned above

*Lorenz is available through Maven Central*.
